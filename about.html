                I am currently a student at GIAIC, pursuing a comprehensive course in Artificial Intelligence, Web 3.0, and the Metaverse. I began my journey into technology in 2023, starting from scratch as a beginner with a passion for exploring and mastering new fields. Since then, I've been constantly evolving, gaining hands-on experience, and learning the latest technologies to stay ahead in this ever-changing landscape.

I am particularly passionate about Artificial Intelligence and its potential to revolutionize industries, as well as Web 3.0 technologies that promise to reshape the way we interact with the digital world. The Metaverse, with its infinite possibilities, is an area I find incredibly exciting and full of potential.

Being a student, I am always looking for opportunities to expand my knowledge, work on practical projects, and contribute meaningfully to the tech community. I am committed to honing my skills in areas such as AI development, blockchain, and immersive virtual experiences. My goal is to not only understand the future of technology but to be an active part of it, creating solutions that make a difference.
